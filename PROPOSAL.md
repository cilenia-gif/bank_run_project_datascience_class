After pondering for a certain time on what could the topic of my project be, I thought about doing a simulation that should reproduce the dynamics of a bank run within an economic system. The simulation would capture the emerge of bank runs and contagion, demonstrating how seemingly small shocks or shifts in behaviour can quickly escalate into large scale financial crisis, and how well-designed economic and financial policies can contain them. 

A bank run is essentially a phenomena that occurs when a large number of depositors withdraw their money at the same time due to the fear that the bank may fail soon. But since banks typically only hold a small fraction of those depositions as liquid cash meanwhile the rest is invested in long-term assets such as bonds, loans, or other securities, they can essentially not meet all withdrawals at once. As the sudden number of withdrawals spikes in a short period of time, the bank may be forced to sell his assets at a fire-sale price or roll over short-term funding, eroding its equity and potentially triggering insolvency. When banks are connected through interbank exposures, one single failure can create a domino effect and spread throughout the system, creating a contagion effect. It turns a local run to a systemic failure, which may be amplified by behavioural and coordination channels such as rumours or media coverage - but policy tools can work as a counteract by reducing panic or providing the needed liquidity. 

This project aims to reproduce these mechanisms in a simplified but flexible simulation that can be extended as implementation progresses. The simulation models several banks, each with a simple compact balance sheet of cash, illiquid assets, deposits, and interbank exposures. Depositors will be aggregated at the bank-level, so each bank faces a withdrawal fraction influenced by external conditions such as panic intensity, liquidity levels, and nearby defaults. This captures the behavioural feedbacks without modelling hundreds of individual agents.

The project is implemented in Python 3.10+ using NumPy, NetworkX, matplotlib, and pytest, following a modular design with different components for behaviour, price impact, contagion, and policy tools. The system evolves step by step: banks process withdrawals, sell assets or borrow if liquidity runs low, update equity, and propagate losses through the network.

Outputs - such as surviving banks, equity levels, and asset prices - will be recorded as time series and visualized with plots to analyse different scenarios. By varying parameters and policy responses, the model will illustrate how stability, contagion, and recovery patterns change under stress.

The main challenge will be maintaining realism while keeping the model manageable. I plan to start with simplified assumptions, validate qualitative patterns, and refine components iteratively.

Success will be shown through realistic, reproducible results across stress levels, with possible extensions such as depositor heterogeneity, richer policy tools, and enhanced market microstructure.
